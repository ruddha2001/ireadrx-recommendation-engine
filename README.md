The recommendation engine is a concept of having the patent data transferred into a graph database and executing queries to answer questions specific to certain business use cases such that the task is significantly easier, less resource-intensive, and less complex when compared to the same being performed by a conventional relational database. The engine is capable of accpeting a single input and forming clusters from the single starting point based on chain queries. The engine can then run the required algorithms on the clusters formed to select the best-fit data.

## How to run the engine?
